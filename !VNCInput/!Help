--------------------------------------------------------------------

  VNCInput is a Risc OS input only client for ORLs Remote Frame Buffer protocol.
It can be used to connect up to any machine running a VNC server and
passes mouse and keyboard events to the remote server.  Useful if you
have 2 computers with monitors next to each other and you don't want
to keep chaning keyboards/mice.


Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The iconbar icon.
    Clicking select on this will open the Connect window if your not
  already connected.  Otherwise it will do nothing.

  The menu.

    Info        - Opens the info window
    Connect     - Opens the connect window to initiate a fresh connection.
    Disconnect  - Disconnect the client.
    Quit        - Quits VNCInput.

  The main window

    There is no main window. Once connected just move the mouse off the right
  hand side of the screen, and input will then be passed over to the remote 
  machine.  To restore input, move the mouse off the left hand side of the
  remote machine and the mouse will reappear.

  The connect window

    This is where you initiate a connection to the server.  The
    window will except address in both numeric and word format.
    The address is then followed by a ':' and the number of the
    display to connect up to (This is displayed when the server
    is run on a Unix/Linux machine, and is usually 0 for a Windows
    Server)
    Next to this is a menu icon, which when clicked on will open
    a menu containing the strings stored in the !VNCInput.hosts file.
    When one of these menu items are clicked on, they are copied into
    the server icon.  This saves you typing them out each time.
    The format of the hosts file is the number of entries on the first
    line, followed by the appropiate number of entries, each on a seperate
    line.

  The connecting Window.

    This displays status messages about how the connection is
    going and if it fails to connect will tell you why.

  The password window.

    This window pops up when you need to type in your password.
    Once the password is typed in, press return to send it, and
    the appropiate authentication routines will run.  I specifically
    overwrite the password, so hopefully it will not be too easy to get
    at :) Pressing Escape instead will cancel the connection process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Known Bugs.

  Apparently it will start up and never appear on the Icon bar, and you
  have to Alt-Break to kill it off before you can do anything.  I've
  not had this happen on my machine, so it may be some software clash.
  If anyone has more details on this, then please let me know.

Acknowledgements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VNCInput uses the C Swi interface written by Peter Naulls.
This swi interface is much faster than the standard ones (Supposedly,
I'm not about to rip them out and use kernel swi calls just to
check *grins*) and thanks to Peter for writing it and allowing
it to be used in Freeware and Shareware programs.

Thanks to ORL for developing VNC (Virtual Network Computing) and
releasing details of the Remote Frame Buffer protocol so I could
write this program.
