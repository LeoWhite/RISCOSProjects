--------------------------------------------------------------------

  CDPlay is a small program to be used for playing Audio CDs.  It 
was written by me when I got a CD-ROM drive for my 4MB A5000 and 
found out that the supplied CD Player took up 160K of memory.  After
looking around and not finding any other player with decent features
that used less then 96K of memory, I decided to write my own.

  CDPlay attempts to display the track information in a style similar
to the 'Fill info' option on a Filer Window.  I.e. it displays track
number, name and size in the same sort of layout.

  CDPlay can support multiply CDROM drives, enabling you to use just
one program to control them all, and can store CD details on to disk
and recall them next time you use that CD.

  It also has function for random and program play, and the usual
time display option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  CDPlay does not use an icon on the icon bar.  Instead you can 
open and close the main window in two ways.  First is by adjust
clicking on the CD Drive icon on the iconbar.  The second way is
by a user configurable hotkey.  By default this is CTRL-SHIFT-TAB.

  The main window consists of the CD Title, current track name,
the CD controls, current track number, time, and a volume bar.


  CD Controls
  ~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  The control icons are, from left to right:
  
    R     - When depressed, selects Random play.
    M     - When depressed, selects memory play

    Previous - When 'Select' clicked, jumps to start of current track,
               or begining of next track.
               When 'Adjust' click, acts as rewind.
    Pause/Play - Pauses or plays/restarts the CD
    Next     - When 'Select' clicked, jumps to start of Next track.
               When 'Adjust' clicked, acts as fast forwards.
    Stop     - Stop
    Eject    - When 'Select' clicked, attempts to eject or close the
               CD drawer depending on current status.
               When 'Adjust' clicked, forces the drive to eject, as
               CDFS can't tell the difference between an empty drive,
               and an open drawer drive.
    

  Time
  ~~~~
  
  The time format can be toggled by clicking on the time part of the
  icon.           
  
  Volume
  ~~~~~~
  
  The volume can be changed by clicking on the appropiate part of
  the bar, or by dragging the slider left and right.  
  This option will only work on drives that support it, and with
  a version of CDFS that supports it.
  
  Track Information
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  Track Number - Plays the appropiate track
  Track Name   - Displays track name.  Click on the icon to edit it.
  Time         - Shows the tracks total length.
  

  Menu
  ~~~~
  
  Apart from the standard Info and Quit options, you also have,
  
  Program - Opens the program window.
  Choices - Loads up the configuration program
  Save    - Saves the current CD Details to disc.
  
 
  The Program Window
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  First off, you CANNOT edit the list of tracks manually.  The only
  reason the icon is writeable, is so that you can scroll the list
  left and right.
  
  To create a program, select 'Program' and then click on the track numbers
  in the main window to add them to the list.

  The Choices Program
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  Most of these options are self explainatery.  But I list here a
  few that may need explaining.
  
  CD matching offset
    Different CDROM drives can report different unique numbers for
    the same CD.  This option enables you to configure the boundaries
    for matching CDs.  CDPlay will look for a CD in the range of
    'Reported number +- offset'
    This option is only useful if you have more than one CDROM drive,
    or you have got a list of CD Details from someone else.
    
  Autodetect CD Change
    CDPlay normally checks at regular intervals if the current CD that is 
    in the drive is the one that it thinks it is playing. This does
    not work with some CDFS drivers, and causes the CDPlay to rescan
    the Listings file to match the CD.  If you have this problem, then
    turn this option off.  The only problem you should then get is if
    you change the CD whilst single tasking, as CDPlay will not spot the
    change.
    
  Check if track is audio
    Some CDFS drivers do not support this.  So if you find that CDPlay
    refuses to play audio tracks, then try turning this option off.
    
  Hotkey code
    This is the hotkey code that opens and closes the main window.
    To change, click in the icon, and press the desired hotkey, and the
    code should then change.
    
  Save current window position
    When selected, the current location of the main window AT THE TIME
    THAT YOU SAVE THE CONFIGURATION will be saved, and the window
    will be opened at that location next time that you run CDPlay.
    
        

  The Listing File
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  This is where CDPlay stores its information on CDs.
  
  To merge the current Listing file with a new one.  Drag the new
  Listing file onto CDPlay's main window.  The new Lising file
  must be either set to text, or data.
  
  SMART CD+ users.  CDPlay can convert and use the Smart CD Version 2
  listing files.  Just drag the Smart CD listing file onto CDPlay's main
  window as mentioned above. 
  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Things To Do
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  -Expand the memory play routines.  Allow saving of playlists etc.
  -Add interactive help.  
  -Rewrite at last part of the program as a module, so it works 
   even whilst outside of the desktop.  i.e When playing games.

Thanks go to my beta testers for helping to find bugs,
suggesting improvements and generally forcing me to make
it into a releasable product, rather than the underdeveloped
version that I was quite happy with at the time ;)

Thanks also go to Acorn's !CDPlayer whose large memory usage
compelled me into writing this program in the first place.
