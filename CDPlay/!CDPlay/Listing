With love in mind
I can't give you anything but love
I've never been in love before
The Lady's in love with you
I'm in the mood for love
Somebody loves me
Can't help falling in love
Hello young lovers
Our love affair
Love me as tho' there were no tomorrow
Love is just around the corner
If love were all
With you in mind
I dream of you more than you dream
Let's fall in love
In other words
My heart stood still
But beautiful
You'll never know
All I do is dream of you
What is there to say
Don't blame me
Falling in love with love
The more I see you

Everybody says don't
Losing my mind
Ah! But underneath

Anyone can whistle

No one is alone

Tell out, my soul - Timothy Dudley-Smith
Fill your hearts with joy and gladness
Tell out, my soul
As water to the thirsty
Lord, for the years
We come as guests invited
Born by the Holy Spirit's breath
Christ is risen
Lighten our darkness
When the Lord in glory comes
Name of all majesty
I lift my eyes to the quiet hills
Safe in the shadow
Holy Child
Christ is the One who calls

Jesus, lover of my soul (It's all about You)
Like a mighty wind (Holy fire)
Lord, I come before Your throne (What a faithful God)
Mighty, mighty Lord
Send Your rain
Sing a song of celebration (We will dance)
Sometimes when I feel Your love (I love Your love)
The angels around Your throne
The day of the streams
The world is looking for a hero (Champion)
This God is our God
This I know
Throughout the earth (Lord, come and reign)
We behold Your glory
We rejoice in the goodness of our God
What noise shall we make?
When you've been broken (Kiss the Son)
Who paints the skies?
Worthy is the Lamb
You are my passion
