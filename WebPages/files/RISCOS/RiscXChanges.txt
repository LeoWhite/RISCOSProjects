History

  Version 0.07
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  - Added 4, 16, and 32bit depth support. Access via the -depth argument
  - Improved the efficency of screen updates in the multi tasking version
    of RiscX. Thus giving a speed increase.
  - Enabled LBX (Low Bandwidth X)

  Version 0.06
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  - Fixed single tasking mode... Which I accidently broke in the 
    previous version...
    
  Version 0.05
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  - Fixed a couple of redraw operations where the screen wasn't fully
    updated in the multi tasking mode.
  - When the mouse leaves the RiscX window it now releases any pressed
    mouse buttons.  This stops the mouse buttons getting stuck down.
  - Now attempts to use the taskwindow sleep upcall to stop it
    pulling as much CPU time when idling.  Tho this doesn't seem
    to have much affect under RISC OS 4.03
    
  Version 0.04
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  - Fixed bug where pointer events were being sent even if the pointer 
    hadn't moved.  This was causing any X client that grabbed the pointer
    to be overwhelmed with X events, making it unusably slow.
  - Added initial keyboard autorepeat support. Currently the delay and repeat
    rate are hardcoded.
  - Compiled up using the latest GCC and Unixlib, increasing the stability.
  - Cleaned up the wait loop so it runs a bit faster.

  Version 0.03
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  - Tided up the source for the modules and put them into CVS
  - Fixed a couple of initialisation bugs, so should now start up
    more reliably.
  - Fixed the 'mouse floating up the right hand side' bug.
  
  Version 0.02
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  - Fixed the pseudo milli second counter (Was going 10 times too fast)
  - Improve double clicks
  - Moved the font directories into a path variable instead.
  - Fixed problem with RiscXInput eating keys when RiscX didn't
    have the focus
  
  Version 0.01
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  - First release.
