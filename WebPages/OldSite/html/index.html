  Welcome to my web pages. A little place I use to distribute my.
  software.  At the moment there's only RISC OS related program available,
  but hopefully I will be able to put some Java programs up soon as well.
 </p>

 <p>
  Right, I've put in a few hours work and put up everything on here
  that was on my old web pages.
